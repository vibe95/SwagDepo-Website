We do not want all the node modules on the github so...

Don't forget to:

npm install **AGAIN USE NPM INSTALL PACKAGE.JSON has been updated.**

Also make sure you have nodejs and Mongodb installed

Use sudo mongod or w/e your terminal command to run the mongoose database then
Use node bin/www to run the site.
